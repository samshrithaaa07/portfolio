      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>My name is Samshritha, and I am currently studying at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
        I have a strong passion for coding, particularly in HTML and CSS, which I enjoy using
        to create engaging and visually appealing web pages. Web development fascinates me, as it
        allows me to combine creativity with technical skills to bring ideas to life.
        I love the challenge of designing user-friendly interfaces and ensuring that websites are
        not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. In addition to my work with HTML and CSS,
        I am eager to learn more about JavaScript and other programming languages to enhance my web development skills.
        I often spend my free time experimenting with new design techniques and exploring the latest trends
        in web technology. I believe that continuous learning is essential in this ever-evolving field,
        and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
        As I progress in my studies, I hope to collaborate with like-minded individuals on projects that push
        the boundaries of web design and development. Ultimately, my goal is to create impactful web experiences
        that resonate with users and contribute positively to the digital landscape.
